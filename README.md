## Obsidian Page Count
This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It's based on AVR's Reading Time Plugin: https://github.com/avr/obsidian-reading-time/

For this plugin to work you need to tell it how many words per page you would like the plugin to calculate with, in the plugin settings in Obsidian.

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.
