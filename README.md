Based on AVR's Reading Time Plugin (https://github.com/avr/obsidian-reading-time)

Plugin for Obsidian.md that shows a page count in the status bar. 
After installing you need to restart Obsidian for the status bar function to start working.

In the plugin settings you need to choose the number of words you want it to count per page, the default is 300.

Example: Your note has 750 words, the status bar would say "2.5 p."
